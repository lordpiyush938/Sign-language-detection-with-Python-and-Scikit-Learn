Sign Language Detection with Python and Scikit-Learn

Overview
This project aims to develop a system for detecting sign language using a webcam. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand landmark detection and Scikit-Learn's RandomForestClassifier for sign classification. The system is capable of recognizing different signs and displaying the corresponding character on the screen.
